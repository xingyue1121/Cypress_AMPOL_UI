This is the solution to Part 2: UI test, written in Cypress, including 
   Scenario A
   Optional/Bonus - Scenario B

Please make sure NodeJS and NPM are installed in your machine before executing the following steps.

Step 1: Retrieve the source code from repo
        git clone https://github.com/xingyue1121/Cypress_AMPOL_UI.git
Step 2: Install all dependencies
        /projectFolder  npm install --save
Step 3: Run the Cypress UI tests on browser (such as Chrome)
        /projectFolder  npx cypress run --browser chrome --headed
           
After the tests complete, you can see in the project folder a intercept_reuslt.json file generated, where the intercepted network response is written.

Bonus: If you want to run the Cypress test via CircleCI, please follow the steps:

Step 1: Setting Up CircleCI:
        a. If you don't already have one, create an account on the CircleCI website (circleci.com).
        b. Establish a connection between CircleCI and your GitHub repository by accessing the "Projects" section and selecting "Set Up Project."
        c. Grant CircleCI appropriate access permissions to your chosen repository.

Step 2: Defining the CircleCI Configuration File:
        a. At the root of your Node.js project, create a file called .circleci/config.yml
         b. Copy the attached config.yml file to your Node.js project

Step 3: Commit and Push to GitHub:
        a. Commit the .circleci/config.yml file to your project's repository.
        b. Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Step 4: Triggering a Build on CircleCI:
        a. Visit the CircleCI dashboard for your project and navigate to the project's page.
        b. Trigger the first build, CircleCI will now execute the defined steps in the configuration file and provide feedback on the build process.
