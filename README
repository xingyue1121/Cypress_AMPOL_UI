This is the solution to Part 2: UI test, written in Cypress, including 
   Scenario A
   Optional/Bonus - Scenario B

Please make sure NodeJS and NPM are installed in your machine before executing the following steps.

Step 1: Retrieve the source code from repo
        git clone https://github.com/xingyue1121/Cypress_AMPOL_UI.git
Step 2: Install all dependencies
        /projectFolder  npm install --save
Step 3: Run the Cypress UI tests on browser (such as Chrome)
        /projectFolder  npx cypress run --browser chrome --headed
           
After the tests complete, you can see in the project folder a intercept_reuslt.json file generated, where the intercepted network response is written.
